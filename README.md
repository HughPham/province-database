# province-database
This is a database construct in province level.

# These data come from 
  - CEIC database
  - Sixty year statistics
  - Regional statistic yearbook
  - Population census every ten years
  
 I would upload the original data and clean data gathering by variables. 
 The data are arranged by province-year unit.
